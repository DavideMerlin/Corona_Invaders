# Corona Invader

Corona Invader is a replica of the famous Space Invader, with a twist. In the game, you impersonate the Unites States, and you will have to beat the coronavirus by shooting syringes or vaccines (depending on your imagination.) This project is part of the youtube video "Python Beginner Projects 2020", which can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9nbdVWl4PA&t=16s
